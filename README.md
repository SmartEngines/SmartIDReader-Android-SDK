# Smart IDReader Android SDK - Demo version

This is a **DEMO** version of [Smart IDReader](http://smartengines.biz/products/smart-id-recognition/) Android SDK by [Smart Engines](http://smartengines.biz) which demonstrates the usage of Smart IDReader library/SDK without actually providing any recognition functionality. 
Instead, it outputs fake results for document search, field segmentation, recognition and photo image extraction. 

Simply open `SmartIDReader-Android-SDK.iml` with Android Studio and run it to see the working example.
You are free to change the code however you want.

More documentation is available in [doc](doc) directory.

Free demonstrational applications with full functionality are available at [Google Play](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=biz.smartengines.smartid) and [App Store](https://itunes.apple.com/app/smart-idreader/id1157877082).

Test and trial/full versions are only different in static library + configuration files so you wouldn't have to rewrite any code after you're finished integrating Smart IDReader SDK into your application.
